###P1: METE fails for microbes
**S1:** Maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE) has been highly successful in predicting how abundance varies within and across communities of macroscopic plants and animals.  
**S2:** Here, we showed that METE fails to explain similar degrees of variance within and among communities of bacteria, archaea, and microscopic fungi.  
**S3:** Likewise, the success of METE is influenced by its primary state variables (*N*, *S*) and by its primary constraint (*N*/*S*).  
**S4:** As a result, METE tends to fail with increasing *N* and *N*/*S*.  
**S5:** Consequently, these conditions also characterize numerical differences between microbial and macrobial SADs.  
**S6:** That is, *N* for microbial datasets often represents tens of thousands to millions of rRNA reads while *N* for macrobial SADs is often ranges between a few hundred to a few thousand individuals.  

###P2: METE fails as expected for large N
**S1:** The failure of the broken stick model and METE could have been anticipated.  
**S2:** It has been shown that as *N* increases, the evenness of the SAD can be expected to decrease as a result of purely numerical constraints (Locey and White 2013).  
**S3:** In the same way, as average abundance (*N*/*S*) increases, the evenness of the SAD can be expected to naturally decrease.  
**S4:** In both cases, constraints on the form of the SAD imposed by *N* and *N*/*S* lead to increasingly uneven SADs that outstrip the relatively even form predicted by the broken-stick as well as the highly uneven form predicted by METE (i.e. the log-series).
**S5:** Yet, it remains to be seen whether the inability of METE to predict microbial SADs is entirely driven by numerical constraints.

###P3:  Biology Rare biosphere
**S1:** The exceptional unevenness of microbial SADs could be driven by factors suggested to explain the presence of the microbial "rare biosphere".  
**S2:** Widespread microbial dispersal and the ability of microbes to persist in suboptimal environments could, together, allow many small populations of dormant or slow-growing populations to persist in a given environment (ref).  
**S3:** Additionally, microorganisms have shown unparalleled capacities to partition resource at ultra-fine levels, e.g., wavelengths of light (ref).  
**S4:** Finally, copies of rRNA sequences do not directly reflect standing abundance and will be influenced by differences in microbial activity and species-specific copy number (ref).  
**S5:** In effect, the failure of the broken-stick model and METE may simultaneously owe as much to constraint-based influences as to biological differences between the ecology of microbes and macrobes.

###P4: Microbial METE
**S1:** The most successful model of species abundance among macroscopic plants and animals appears to fail among communities of bacteria, archaea, and microscopic fungi.  
**S2:** Whether due to massive differences in *N* and *N*/*S* between microbes and macrobes, which likewise owe to differences in their biology, or to factors suggested to explain the microbial "rare biosphere", ecologists are still challenged to find an appropriate model to accurately predict microbial SADs.  
**S3:** To this end, we suggest an SAD model with naturally greater unevenness, i.e., the Zipf-distribution.  
**S4:** While the broken-stick provides a relatively even distribution and the log-series provides a relatvely uneven distribution, the Zipf-distribution provides one the most uneven distributions for SADs and can likewise be derived as a prediction of MaxEnt (Baek et al. 2011).  
**S5:** In comparison to METE, the Zipf would simultaneously predict greater numbers of singletons and a greater abundance for the most abundant species, which would presumably provide a better fit to microbial SADs. 
**S6:** In fact, as a MaxEnt prediction, the Zipf "...provides the best prediction for the number of groups with *k* elements, given the total number of elements (*N*), groups (*S*), & the number of elements in the largest group (*Nmax*).
**S7:** In this way, a suitable MaxEnt prediction for microbial SADs may require *Nmax* as a constraint, which is not needed or does not improve SAD predictions for plants and animals.
**S8:** To our knowledge, no analytical formalulation of the Zipf as a MaxEnt prediction based on *N*, *S*, and *Nmax* is available, but is potentially needed for extending SAD theory to large communities of macrobes or very small communities of microbes.

###P5: Conclusion
**S1:** Constraint-based biodiversity theory provides a first-principle framework for predicting biodiversity patterns based solely on empirical inputs.  
**S2:** While MaxEnt frameworks infer no ecological processes they also avoid a common source of error in the study of commonness and rarity, i.e., inferring the importance of a process that has gone unverified and unmeasured (e.g., speciation, niche differentiation, coexistence).  
**S3:** Yet, it seems clear from our study that the maximum entropy theory of ecology, which effectively predicts the log-series, will fail for communities of very large *N*, such as microbiomes where *N* easily exceeds many trillion.  
**S4:** Consequently, while the microbial "rare biosphere" appears to be an exceptional phenomenon, we cannot yet say whether the cause is due more to the biology driving rarity independent of *N* or to the biology that allows microbes to attain such high degrees of *N*.
